## 1. Prerequisites:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:
pandas (for data manipulation)
matplotlib (for data visualization)

## 2. Download the Dataset:

You'll need to download the "netflix_data.csv"  dataset containing Netflix movie information, including title, country, genre, release year, and duration.

Save the provided Python code as a .py file.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
Run the script 

## 4. Interpretation:

The script will generate a scatter plot with duration on the y-axis and release year on the x-axis. Each data point represents a movie, and its color is determined by genre (red: Children, blue: Documentaries, green: Stand-Up, black: Other).
By visually inspecting the plot, you can try to identify any trends. Are there more short movies in recent years compared to older movies?

## 5. Further Exploration:

This script provides a starting point for analyzing movie trends on Netflix. You can modify the code to explore different aspects of the data:
Filter movies based on specific countries or release decades.
Calculate average movie duration by genre or release year.
Create additional plots (e.g., histograms) to analyze the distribution of movie durations.
